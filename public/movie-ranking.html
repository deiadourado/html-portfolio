<h1>The Best Movies According to Andreia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Time Traveler's Wife</h3>
<p>This is my favourite romance movie, there's a lot of drama and a little bit of sci-fi.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter (all movies)</h3>
<p>I really can't imagine a world without magic. Can you?</p>

<h3>One Tree Hill</h3>
<p>Okay, despite any judgement, I know OTH is not a movie, buuuuut I can't handle myself if I love a good drama.</p>
